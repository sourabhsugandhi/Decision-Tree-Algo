# Decision-Tree-Algo

######  A decision tree is one of most frequently and widely used supervised machine learning algorithms that can perform both regression and classification tasks

######  In this section, we will implement the decision tree algorithm on both classification as well as regression problems

##  Classificaion problem: 
######  Predict whether a bank note is authentic or fake depending upon the four different attributes of the image of the note

##  Regression problem:
######  Predict gas consumptions (in millions of gallons) in 48 US states based upon gas tax (in cents), per capita income (dollars), paved highways (in miles) and the proportion of population with a drivers license.
